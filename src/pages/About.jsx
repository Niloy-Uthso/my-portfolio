          I'm <span className="font-semibold">Niloy Sarkar Uthso</span>, a developer driven by curiosity and creativity.
          <br /><br />
          I started my journey in tech with a strong focus on problem solving, regularly practicing on platforms like Codeforces,UVa,LeetCode etc. Over time, I found my passion expanding into <span className="font-medium text-primary">MERN stack development</span>, where I could bring full applications to life from frontend to backend.
          <br /><br />
          I enjoy building meaningful, clean, and scalable web experiences. My aim is always to write code that not only works â€” but feels right.
          <br /><br />
          When I'm not coding, I recharge by diving into <span className="italic">music</span>, following <span className="italic">cricket</span>, or immersing myself in <span className="italic">spiritual and religious activities</span>. I walk through life guided by faith in my Bhairava and beloved mother Durga who gives me strength, focus, and clarity.
